# Inflation Rate and Consumer Price Index (CPI)
## Source Descriptions
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of changes in the prices of goods and services consumed by urban households in Iran. This index is considered one of the best indicators for measuring the overall level of prices of goods and services consumed by households, and it is also a key measure of changes in purchasing power of the currency within the country. The inflation rate for each month is derived from calculating the percentage change in the average CPI over the twelve months leading up to the specified month, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. It is worth noting that if the specified month is Esfand (December), it is referred to as the annual inflation rate.
